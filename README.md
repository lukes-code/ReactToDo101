## React To Do

This to do list is made with react. <br />
<br />
This to do list uses JSON Placeholders via a http get request to a fake REST API by using Axios, to demonstrate to do list items as an example of what the to do list would be like, should it have the backend for it.<br />
<br />
As the placeholders are hosted on an external API, when you refresh the page any example to do's you delete locally will be called in again as they're not actually deleted from the source.<br />
